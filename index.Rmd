# Preface {-}

On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) a Public Health Emergency of International concern (PHEIC)
and within six weeks had characterized the outbreak as a pandemic. Compared
to the 2003-2004 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) PHEIC, the
COVID-19 pandemic spreads more quickly and with a much higher death toll.
However, the current pandemic is occurring in a more digital and
interconnected world. Traditional public health organizations as well as
data-mature organizations not traditionally involved directly in public
health have rapidly developed digital disease surveillance infrastructuree
that provides nearly realtime epidemic tracking data. These data resources
have proven invaluable to understanding disease spread, to drive
non-pharmacologic intervention (NPI), and, when combined with additional
data resources, to project impacts to communities and healthcare systems
around the world. Even as the urgency of the initial "hammer" of the
COVID-19 pandemic begins to abate, the need for timely, robust, and granular
datasets will inform business, policy, and even personal decisions for
months or even years to come. This package provides documentation and
one-function access to highly-cited COVID-19 datasets and secondary data
that allow real-time analysis, visualization, and interpretation of the
state of COVID-19 at a community, national, or international level.
    
The accompanying [`sars2pack` R package](https://github.com/seandavi/sars2pack) seeks to:

* Collect COVID-19 related public health and disease tracking
resourcesand provide principled approach date reuse and
reproducible computational research.
* Provide a data science environment for researchers, media,
policy makers, and data scientists to collaborate while promoting
reproducible computational research best practices.
* Capitalize on the large, existing multidisciplinary data science
workforce already familiar with the R programming environment.
* Create opportunities for individuals not well-versed in data
science to learn and experiment with COVID-19 datasets.
* Incorporate examplar workflows that leverage the extensive R
data science ecosystem to visualize, analyze, and integrate
COVID-19 data resources.
