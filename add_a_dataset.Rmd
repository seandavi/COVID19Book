# How to add a new dataset to `sars2pack`

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

Most datasets in sars2pack are accessed directly from their url(s) online.
We have not stored datasets in the package because most interesting datasets
are being updated quite regularly. At a high level, adding a new dataset includes
the following steps.

1. Add an R file that contains a single accessor for the dataset.
2. Consider using the s2p_cached_url() (see help('caching')) functionality to 
use BiocFilecache capabilities. 
3. Add an entry to the `inst/data_catalog/catalog.yaml`, using a previous
entry as a template.
4. Run the `create_dataset_details()` function to add your dataset details
to the `inst/data_catalog/dataset_details.yaml`.
5. Run devtools::test() to ensure that your dataset passes tests. 

## Add an R file.

This file should return the munged dataset. Take care to convert date columns to actual
dates, convert to long-form tidy data where possible (to facilitate dplyr/ggplot paradigms).

Roxygen ocumentation should contain:

- Title
- Description
- Author
- Source (usually a URL)
- Reference
- Examples (head, colnames, dplyr::glimpse, and potentially more complicate use cases)
- `@family data-import` and potentially other families. Check with package authors for suggestions.

## Caching using s2p_cached_url

See, for example, the source for usa_facts_data.

## Add an entry to `catalog.yaml`

The `catalog.yaml` file is in `inst/data_catalog`. The file 
drives the `available_datasets()` function, allowing us to rapidly
update with new functionality. 

Here is an example of what such an entry looks like:

``` yaml
  - name: Kaiser Family Foundation ICU bed data
    accessor: kff_icu_beds
    data_type: healthcare capacity 
    region: United States
    resolution: Individual hospital
    geospatial: true
    geographical: true
    url: https://khn.org/news/as-coronavirus-spreads-widely-millions-of-older-americans-live-in-counties-with-no-icu-beds
```

Simply edit this file and add one entry per dataset that you add.

##  Run the `create_dataset_details()` function

The `create_dataset_details()` function runs through all the accessors in
`catalog.yaml` and collects:

- Column names
- Column types
- Dataset dimensions (rows, columns)
- For datasets with a `date` column, we capture the start and end dates

These data are written to `inst/data_catalog/dataset_details.yaml` and are
used to drive automated tests for all datasets. 

## Run `devtools::test()` 

All datasets will be tested against the column details in `dataset_details.yaml`. This
allows us to ensure that datasets, which are grabbed *out of the wild* are not malformed
compared to what we expect.
