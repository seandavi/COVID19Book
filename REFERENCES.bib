  abstract  = "Decision makers are responsible for directing staffing,
               logistics, selecting public health interventions, communicating
               to professionals and the public, planning future response needs,
               and establishing strategic and tactical priorities along with
               their funding requirements. Decision makers need to rapidly
               synthesize data from different experts across multiple
               disciplines, bridge data gaps and translate epidemiological
               analysis into an operational set of decisions for disease
               control. Analytic approaches can be defined for specific
               response phases: investigation, scale-up and control. These
               approaches include: improved applications of quantitative
               methods to generate insightful epidemiological descriptions of
               outbreaks; robust investigations of causal agents and risk
               factors; tools to assess response needs; identifying and
               monitoring optimal interventions or combinations of
               interventions; and forecasting for response planning. Data
               science and quantitative approaches can improve decision-making
               in outbreak response. To realize these benefits, we need to
               develop a structured approach that will improve the quality and
               timeliness of data collected during outbreaks, establish
               analytic teams within the response structure and define a
               research agenda for data analytics in outbreak response. This
               article is part of the theme issue 'Modelling infectious disease
               outbreaks in humans, animals and plants: epidemic forecasting
               and control'. This theme issue is linked with the earlier issue

                   reduce the transmission rate of the severe acute respiratory

                   indicate that a large reduction in mobility has taken place,

  abstract = {Background: United States government scientists estimate that COVID-19 may kill between 100,000 and 240,000 Americans. The majority of the pre-existing conditions that increase the risk of death for COVID-19 are the same diseases that are affected by long-term exposure to air pollution. We investigate whether long-term average exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) increases the risk of COVID-19 deaths in the United States. Methods: Data was collected for approximately 3,000 counties in the United States (98\% of the population) up to April 04, 2020. We fit zero-inflated negative binomial mixed models using county-level COVID-19 deaths as the outcome and county level long-term average of PM2.5 as the exposure. We adjust by population size, hospital beds, number of individuals tested, weather, and socioeconomic and behavioral variables including, but not limited to obesity and smoking. We include a random intercept by state to account for potential correlation in counties within the same state. Results: We found that an increase of only 1 {$\mu$}g/m3 in PM2.5 is associated with a 15\% increase in the COVID-19 death rate, 95\% confidence interval (CI) (5\%, 25\%). Results are statistically significant and robust to secondary and sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: A small increase in long-term exposure to PM2.5 leads to a large increase in COVID-19 death rate, with the magnitude of increase 20 times that observed for PM2.5 and all-cause mortality. The study results underscore the importance of continuing to enforce existing air pollution regulations to protect human health both during and after the COVID-19 crisis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was made possible by the support from the NIH grant R01 ES024332-01A1, P50MD010428, ES024012, ES026217, ES028033; MD012769, HEI grant 4953-RFA14-3/16-4, and USEPA grants 83587201-0, RD-83479801.
